# Dijkstras-Impliment-on-Lattice

This was a quick project for my Algorithms class to impliment Dijkstras. We were given a fixed hexagonal lattice to resolve a shortest path for given nodes. Unfortunately, I no longer have the lattice we were to map, and for some reason my comments seem targetted towards an informed audience.
