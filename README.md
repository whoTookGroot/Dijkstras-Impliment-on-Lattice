# Dijkstras-Impliment-on-Lattice

This was a quick project for my Algorithms class to impliment Dijkstras. We were given a fixed hexagonal lattice to resolve a shortest path for given nodes. Unfortunately, I no longer have the lattice we were to map, and for some reason my comments seem targetted towards an informed audience. 

Rather than making nested classes, the project elements were split into their own files so as to better highlight their function and scope.
